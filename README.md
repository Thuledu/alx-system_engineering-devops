Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!

Here are the steps to follow:

Take the screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.
Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the hostname, username, and password provided to you for the sandbox environment.
Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots.
